# Market-Research-Data-Pipeline-ETL

Using the 'Google Play Store Apps' dataset provided by DataCamp to build an ETL pipeline with pandas to extract from CSV files and to load into an SQL database. The pipeline can show information on popular and high-rating apps based on a user-defined category, minimum rating, and minimum reviews. The pipeline includes logging for detailed tracking and data validation to ensure data accuracy. I later re-implemented the same functionality using PySpark to enhance the pipeline's ability to handle large-scale data.
